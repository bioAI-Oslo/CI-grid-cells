## Grid Theory

A comprehensive summary of the lattice-theoretic basics that are necessary to 
understand what we did in this project and how they relate to the 
grid cell ratemap pattern and its interpretation as a planar hexgonal lattice
is provided in the 
[Grid-Theory notebook](https://github.com/Vemundss/grid-cells/blob/main/Grid-Theory.ipynb).
